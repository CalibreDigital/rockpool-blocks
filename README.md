Rockpool Blocks
===============

A Wordpress plugin providing a series of custom Gutenberg editor blocks, for creating custom landing pages.

Bootstrapped with [Create Guten Block](https://github.com/ahmadawais/create-guten-block).

This project uses Webpack during development, so to make it watch and build from the files in /src, run `npm install` and then `npm start`.
